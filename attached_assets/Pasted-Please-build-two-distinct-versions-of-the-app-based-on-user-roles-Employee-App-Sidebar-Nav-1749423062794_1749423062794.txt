Please build two distinct versions of the app, based on user roles:

🧑‍💼 Employee App: Sidebar Navigation Items
Please add the following as separate sidebar items (pages/sections):

My Expenses – View submitted expense claims

Files – Create a dedicated section for uploaded documents or files

Invoices – View/download past invoices or payslips

Profile – Expand to include:

Personal info

Optional address field

Emergency contact section

Time Tracking – Submit hours worked or clock in/out

Time Off – Request/view leave

Include a calendar view for better visibility

Benefits – View available perks or company policies

Tax & Compliance – View and upload tax documents

Withdrawal Method – Submit payout preference:

BTC wallet address

Bank account details

Notifications – View status updates for payroll, requests, etc.

Messages (Optional) – Message or receive communication from admin

👨‍💼 Admin App: Sidebar Navigation Items
Along with the already existing navigation items, please add:

Employees – View and manage employee data

Payroll – Manage and send payments

Withdrawal Methods – View submitted payout preferences

Approvals – Approve expenses, time off, and time tracking

Invoices & Reports – View/export invoices and CSV reports

PDF Payslips – Generate downloadable payslips

Tax & Compliance – View tax documents by employee

Audit Logs – Track changes (e.g., edits, deletions, payments)

Messages (Optional) – Communicate with employees

Bulk Payroll – Run payroll payments for multiple employees at once

🔄 Testing Instructions
I need to test both user roles, so please do one of the following:

Allow role selection on signup (admin vs. employee), or

Preload test accounts for each role

✅ Additional Notes
Do not modify the login or registration pages — the current UI/UX is perfect.

Keep all current styling and UI:

Orange-themed design

Sidebar layout and responsiveness

Animations, transitions, and mobile compatibility

If certain navigation items can be logically grouped (e.g., under categories like "HR", "Finance", or "Settings"), feel free to organize them that way. The goal is to maintain clarity without overwhelming users.
