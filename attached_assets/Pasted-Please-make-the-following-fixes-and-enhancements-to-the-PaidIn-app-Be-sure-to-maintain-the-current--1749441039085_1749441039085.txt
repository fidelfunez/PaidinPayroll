Please make the following fixes and enhancements to the PaidIn app. Be sure to maintain the current design system and UI/UX, especially the login and registration pages, which are complete and should remain unchanged.

1. 🦶 Employee Footer Links
On the employee side of the app:

Remove or replace footer links that are restricted to admin users (e.g., Reports).

Replace them with links relevant and accessible to employees only.

2. 📂 Sidebar Navigation Behavior
On both admin and employee sides:

When a user clicks a category that contains sub-items, keep that category expanded even after navigating to a sub-item.

Currently, the category collapses, which causes a poor UX.

3. 👤 Profile Editing Consistency
On the employee side, there are two profile editing areas:

Settings > Profile

Personal > Profile

Ensure both:

Sync seamlessly (editing one updates the same info as the other)

Do not conflict or cause bugs/crashes

4. ✅ Functional Features (Remove Mockups)
Convert all mockups or placeholders into working features wherever possible.

No more "coming soon" or fake buttons — make sure every feature is either functional or clearly marked and safely inactive.

5. 🔐 Stronger Password Requirements
Implement strong password validation:

At least 1 uppercase letter

At least 1 number

At least 1 special character

Also, prompt existing users without strong passwords to update their passwords before continuing use.

6. 📱 Mobile Sidebar Bug
Fix mobile layout issues where the sidebar overlaps the main screen (even when collapsed).

Use a responsive drawer/menu approach if needed

Ensure smooth navigation on all screen sizes

7. 📄 Static Pages – Basic Placeholder Content
Ensure the following pages/links are fully functional — even with basic placeholder content:

Help Center

API Documentation

Security

Settings

Privacy Policy

Terms of Service

Each should have a separate route/page and contain at least minimal placeholder text.

8. 💬 Bitcoin Quote Rotation
Fix the issue with the rotating Bitcoin quotes (e.g., from Hal Finney, Satoshi, Andreas).

These quotes should update every 10 minutes

Confirm the backend logic is working correctly and triggering updates

Quotes should be displayed dynamically and visibly rotate

✅ Final Notes:

Keep the orange-themed styling, animations, layout, and sidebar intact.

You may group navigation items logically to reduce clutter but retain full functionality.
